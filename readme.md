[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b2be1c66-1374-4262-93af-3851244cd3d9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tylerquinlivan/deploys)

This repo holds the build files for [www.tylerquinlivan.com](https://www.tylerquinlivan.com).

It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the base theme is [this beautiful console theme](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console/) built by Marcin Mierzejewski, with some minor tweaks. Automatic deployments are managed by [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com), which watches for any new pushes to this main branch and re-builds the site.
