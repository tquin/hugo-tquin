# Static Sites with Hugo

This repo holds the build files for [www.tylerquinlivan.com](https://www.tylerquinlivan.com).

It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the base theme is [this beautiful console theme](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console/) built by Marcin Mierzejewski. Automatic deployments are managed by [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com), which watches for any new pushes to this main branch and re-builds the site.
