Nothing can top the crunch factor on this bad boy.

In fact, I would _almost_ argue that this biscuit can lean into being _too crunchy_ sometimes. Frankly, it's a little too much for me, but that is not a nock against the young Butternut - it's raison d'Ãªtre is instead as the humble **cuppa companion.**

Because when you pair this with your favourite tea, it is beautiful. The normally slightly harsh oat-and-syrup flavour fades into a lovely blend, and that signature crunch disappears into a malleable delight. 

Now, I do take issue with the fact that this is advertised blatently on the packaging as a _cookie._ I don't know about you, but what is effectively a national-favourite [Anzac Biscuit][link_anzac] should not be taking a dirty Yankee _cookie_ for its namesake.

Regardless, naming issues aside, let me set the scene: it's a Sunday morning. You grab your current paperback, flip the kettle on, and rustle around for a biscuit to suit. You would be hard pressed to find a better choice than the Butternut for its niche.
