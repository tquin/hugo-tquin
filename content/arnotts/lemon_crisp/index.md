I like lemon desserts, but this abomination stands alone.

Lemon slice, lemon cheesecake, lemon cake, [lemongrab][link_lemongrab], lemon sorbet, lemon meringue - what an excellent ingredient for a slight tang against your sweet sugar. 

However, these biscuits introduce *salt.* The biscuits themselves (which are closer to a cracker) are not sweet by themselves; they lack the staple Arnott's ingredients of golden syrup and coconut that are used so frequently for a homely feel. What you get instead is a savoury salt layered with a lemon cream.

Perhaps individually, either of these could work well in a biscuit. Together, they don't personally provide a nice experience for me. I am aware I am in a minority in this opinion; the Lemon Crisp has survived for a long time, so it must be a viable offering. It does not take much effort to find people singing their praises, enjoying a delicate balance of the flavours on offer here.

The world would be a boring place if we all agreed on everything, as is often said. Despite my harsh assertion beginning this post, I am glad the Lemon Crisp is around. I know my beloved [Mint Slice][link_mint_slice] is not beloved by all, and nor is the [Caramel Crown][link_caramel_crowns] a well-renowned favourite. This is my list, and the Lemon Crisp will not fair favourably, but the discussion they generate is well worth the price of admission.
