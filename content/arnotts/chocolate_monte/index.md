No, it's not the Monte Carlo.

But I'm sure they get confused all the time.

These are a classic, sweet biscuit, with honey and golden syrup - what Arnott's excels at. Coating that is a rich dark chocolate which compliments it well.

Something about the colour scheme of the packet and the simplicity feels delightfully quaint, and that's what I'm looking for in a biscuit.

If anything, I do find the chocolate a little overpowering; but, if that's your thing, this is a very solid option. It's not going to win any stand-out awards, but I think most people would be happy to go "huh, not bad," and if that isn't success, then I don't know what is.
