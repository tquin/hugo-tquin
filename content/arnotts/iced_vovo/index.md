Arnott's got it right when they called it 'an Australian icon.'

I'm going to get it out of the way earlier - as I said in the [Iced Vovo - Lamington][link_iced_vovo_lamington] review:

> I _love_ Iced VoVos. The soft biscuit base, ~~marshmallow~~ fondant, coconut, raspberry jam - it is iconic.

But please, allow me to indulge in some further detail. Because beyond the biscuit themselves, Iced Vovos _are_ iconic in the Aussie imagination. From a [bickie-addicted Prime Minister boosting sales][link_kevin_rudd], to [created a milk spin-off][link_strawberry_milk], to inspiring a [craft beer imitation][link_beer], there are countless examples of the raspberry and coconut archetype infecting pop-culture. And there is a good, simple reason for this: **it's good.**

So, let's get down to brass tacks. Unabashedly, I love this biscuit, but where does that place it on the list? Very high. At the time of writing, the current top-spot is the [Raspberry Shortcake][link_raspberry_shortcake], and to be frank, it's tough to choose between the two; I would be delighted with either offering an afternoon tea cuppa. 

To choose between the two, I'm going to go with what I consider to be the underdog between the two. Beyond that, the Shortcake also wins on dunkability, which is an important metric behind these calculations. But _damn_, it's close. Fair play to you, Iced VoVo. Long may she reign as the great Australian biscuit icon.
