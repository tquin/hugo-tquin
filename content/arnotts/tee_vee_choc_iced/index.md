The penultimate review in the Krispy Kreme collaboration is not the ultimate in ranking.

The choc biscuits, alongside the [Original Glazed][link_original_glazed], are the least aesthetically interesting out of the bunch, and I feel that unfortunately carries over to their flavour, too.

Overall, these are fine, but just a little boring. They share in the same sin as the [Delta Cream][link_delta_cream] in my eyes, and that is to play their cards too safely. There is little challenge or excitment in a cocoa biscuit, and stamping a hole in the middle as part of a marketing stunt does little counteract that negative force. It's hard to blame a biscuit for being chocolate over a sweet crumb; as they say, _'No one ever got fired for buying IBM.'_

With just Kookies and Kreme to go, we will have to see how the final order shakes out in this mini-series.
