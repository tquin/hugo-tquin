Did you ever make those little lolly-face biscuits with [Maries][link-marie] in primary school?

I'm talking about [these][link-lolly-face] [things][link-lolly-face-2], where you'd get a plain biscuit, make some simple icing (food colouring highly encouraged), and decorate!

Tic Tocs strongly remind me of making these things in primary school, or at home with Mum. Something about the bright colours, the kid-friendly aesthetic, and the sugary taste bring back that lovely warm nostalgia.

The white, yellow, and pink variations add to the fun too. The icing here is incredibly sugary, like you can feel the enamel melting off your teeth as you bite it, but in some sense that simple flavour helps make them feel more homemade. I wouldn't blame you at all if the sweetness is off-putting, but I do find it nice _in moderation._

The clock face is a nice gimmick, too. I'm not sure how effective these would be at teaching kids to read an analogue clock, but it's a novelty. It does make me wonder how these are produced, though - does the factory have dozens of stamps to produce the different clock hands? It seems like it's probably an annoying headache to manufacture, but the effect is certainly worth it.

I'm not going to say these are the most sophisticated biscuit Arnott's produces. The biscuit is very basic, and doesn't have any of the complex flavour of a Kingston or Scotch Finger. The icing can be overwhelming, and isn't the lovely velvety texture of the [Monte Carlo][link-monte-carlo] cream. Tic Tocs are very simple, and they embrace that. 

I can't help but be delighted with these and the nostalgia they bring on. They are far from the top of the ranking, but I can't hate them either. Tic Tocs are a beatiful, innocent, middle-of-the-pack biscuit that makes me happy for more than just the taste.
