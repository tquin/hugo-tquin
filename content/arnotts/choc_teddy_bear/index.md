Simplicity can be bliss.

In all honesty, I was fairly sure that I had already written one of these for the Teddy Bear varieties -- because how could I _not?_ They are perhaps just as iconic as the 'staple' chocolate choices of the [Mint Slice][link_mint_slice], [Tim Tam][link_tim_tam], even the Wagon Wheel _(which must be on the list!)_, but I suspect are not as popular a purchase, and I think I know why.

I say _simplicity_ because there isn't a lot to this thing. It's a plain wheaty biscuit -- which is, of course, kind of Arnott's thing -- coated in a simple milk chocolate. Fundamentally, it's pretty similar to the [Monte][link_chocolate_monte] (non-Carlo), with milk chocolate replacing the dark. Flavour-wise, this is not going to blow anyone away.

What the Teddy Bears do have going for them is the design. Like the [Tic Toc][link_tic_toc] or hundres and thousands before it, it's kid-friendly. But here is my question: beyond nostalgia, what reason do you have to choose these? I can't think of many. Sure, it's a nice biscuit, but it's also... unremarkable. It's not a coffee-dunker, it's not a flavourful cream, nor a textural phenomenon like a Anzac; and where does that leave you? With a perfectly delicious and memorable biscuit, that just can't compete on the supermarket shelf.
