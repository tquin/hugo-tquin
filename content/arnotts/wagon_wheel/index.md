First, we need to address the size debate.

If a biscuit can be said to cause a controversy, this is certainly it. Not in its composition or flavour, but in dimension. Many people will passionately argue that the Wheels have shrunken since their childhood, myself included. I remember these being easily the size of my hand, where they now are only slightly over an average bickie.

And therein lies the issue. Relatively, my hands have grown, while the [British manufacturers claim][link_british_denial] they've never changed the size. That doesn't address the strange legal situation where different companies in Canada, the UK, and Australia produce Wagon Wheels, but it is a convincing argument nonetheless.

How does it _taste,_ though? In short: good. It's particularly nostalgic for me, reminiscent of sitting in camping chairs watching race cars as a kid. Marshmallow and jam is a proven combination, and the biscuit is deliciously crumbly. I do personally find the chocolate a little biting, but in small doses that's not a problem.

Overall, you would be hard-pressed to find a more globally loved biscuit. But does it stack up on the definitive list? Sort of. As delightful as the Wagon Wheel is, it's not a staple. I can only really enjoy it on the once-in-a-blue-moon timescale, because it doesn't have the staying power of other options. This ultimately places it in the upper end of mid-range for me.
