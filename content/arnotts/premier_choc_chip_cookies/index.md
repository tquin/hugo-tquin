News to me that Arnott's has a 'farmbake' sub-brand -- this review series will truly never run out of content.

In fact, there are more Farmbake products seemingly only available in New Zealand, like [Crunchy Oat & Fruit][link_oat_and_fruit] or [Peanut Brownie][link_peanut_brownie]. Anyone willing to import for me?

In doing my usual weekly shop - ironically, buying ingredients to bake my own choc-chip cookies - I stumbled upon an aisle-end, marked-down collection of these cookie boxes. I suspect you are now thinking precisely what I was in that moment: "Wait, Arnott's makes those sort of cheap-but-delicious cookie boxes?" Well, yes (in fact, you're reading this page; you probably could have answered that rhetorical yourself).

This category of product is actually very well established. You might familar with the Colesworth bottom-of-the-barrel version of these; I certainly am.

So the question is: how does Arnott's take compare? Well, in all honestly, there's little difference, at least in taste. Unlike my [Gaiety review][link_gaiety] in which there was a bump up in quality, I suspect if you did a side-by-side between the $0.99 bag and these, the only notable differentiatior would be how strangely _powdery_ the cheaper ones can be. Taste-wise, these are basically identical.

However, that's not to say these are bad, because quite frankly, those bottom-shelf bags **absolutely slap.** They're not going to compete with homemade, but they have a certain nostalgia that keeps me coming back every now and then.
