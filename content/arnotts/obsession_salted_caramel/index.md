Happy New Year! New year, new biscuits, same me. On the chopping block today is the second in the _Obsession_ series -- which has been significantly delayed due to my absolute refusal to pay full price for these, purely out of principle.

But enough about silly things like _value propositions_ and the _dimishing value of a dollar!_ I raved far too long about how ridiculously not-worth-it these Obsessions are in the first [Mint Chocolate][link_mint_choc] review, so let's agree to take that as a given and move forwards with our lives so I don't feel the need to regurgitate my sentiments again.

So down to brass tacks; what's it like? It's **intruiging** at the very least. The skyscraper thickness of this bickie class gives a lot of room to work with, and they do make use of it by combining elements that you simply don't see in the heterogeneity of most Tim-Tams. In this case, you start with a very crunchy base, a surrounding nougat filling, and a core of soft caramel. Add to that the common element across this category, the chips -- here, obviously, being chips of salted caramel. And I will be honest, they add a lot more to the final product than I might have expected. Having the textural difference, the sudden pang of salt smoothed by a deep dark chocolate, brings a good kind of variety. 

I've never professed to be the biggest dark chocolate lover in the world, but I do have a soft spot for a good caramel, and that these are. A [Caramel Crown][link_caramel_crown] in comparison would now feel underwhelming, I suspect. They rank highly -- _but still with a smear on their reputation._
