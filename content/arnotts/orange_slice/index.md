Being really really old does not mean it is good; take [Rupert Murdoch][link_murdoch], for example.

But jokes about evil people aside, we're dealing with an evil biscuit today. 

The orange slice, with its place in the coveted Assorted Creams, is a stand-out for being routinely awful. Arnott's will boast about _'real oranges!'_ on the packet, but the ingredients list reveal this to be an oil extract and a citric acid, which results in an extremely concentrated flavour. I'm a fan of citrus sweets in general, but this disappoints with a chemical-y and overall artificial impression.

Other than the [r/unexpectedfactorial][link_unexpected_factorial] in that description _(it's roughly 10^1709 by the way, after the heat death of the universe),_ I'm fairly certain it's also a typo. Woolworths and Coles' descriptions both list it as 1922, a much more impressive age to be boasting about. Seriously, between this and biscuits [missing from their website][link_black_forest], I'm don't know if there's anyone left on the maintenance team when the company was sold.

Anyway, back on topic. I'm not alone on this tirade, by the way. It's at a point that news of the organisation restructure led to speculation that the biscuit [might be axed][link_smh], and it's the even become the [victim of political satire][link_betoota].

If you couldn't tell by now, the Orange Slice will not be scoring highly on the definitive list. At the time of writing, it will debut at number 19 - the current bottom of the barrel.

_(I bought an entire individual packet of these for this review instead of an Assorted Creams pack - think of my sacrafice and don't make the same mistake, please.)_
