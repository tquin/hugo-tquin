I have wandered the desert for a long time, from Tee Vee Snack to citrus abomination; it is time to come home.

The Kingston is, in my opinion, impossible to hate. It follows in the footsteps of many others in the 'icing between two biscuits' genre, and is damn near the peak of that category. Extreme crunch, punchy oat and coconut, and finalising with a beatiful creamy chocolate.

What cements the Kingston's in their place is without a doubt their place in the Assorted Creams package, where they align with the Monte Carlo in domination. Both are excellent, especially in their cream, but what sets today's biscuit above its competition is the biscuit base instead. The crunch combined with the biting aftertaste is unique across the Arnott's range, and it's hard to describe or replicate. 

Let's be honest, you didn't need this review. You know what a Kingston is, and you know that you like it. The only question remaining comes down to the ranking. While I think it may be the best all-rounder biscuit for most people (an accomplishment not to be diminished), it won't take the top spot of mine. That honour, at the time of publishing, remains the Raspberry Shortcake, but the Kingston will still make it onto the podium.
