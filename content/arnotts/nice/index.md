I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is the best bickie in the [Family Assorted][link-family-assorted] pack.

The biscuit base is crunchy, plain enough to be versatile, and made unique by its delightful inclusion of the granulated sugar. The Nice (or is it the _Nice_) won't blow anyone away, but you would be hard-pressed to find a more reliably satisfying choice.

> A perfect staple for any pantry. Arnott's Nice plain biscuits are made the old-fashioned way with no artificial colours, flavours or preservatives and a generous sprinkle of sugar to create a satisfyingly sweet biscuit. Delicious!

I'm not sure how confident I am in this decision, but I think the Nice _may_ be the best dipping biscuit Arnott's makes, period. The natural crunch means that it doesn't crumble after a journey into the tea, but keeps enough of its original structure to be better than by itself. Unlike some louder choices, the Nice is humble enough to stay out of the way, not insisting it must be the star of the show, but pleasant enough to enjoy on its own all the same.

The only other real contenders I can think of in the dip-a-thon would be the [Milk Coffee][link-milk-coffee] (which is shaped like a Fool's Gold imitation of the Nice), or maybe the [Scotch Finger][link-scotch-finger], but that's so unique on it's own that tea is never the focus.

This biscuit isn't a headliner, setting smaller goals than a Fancy Cream, but excels in its category. That's a quality I can admire. It's hard to sum it up better than the category it sits in, 'Simple Pleasures'; what a sweet sentiment.
