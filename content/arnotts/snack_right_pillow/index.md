What if we had a sugary biscuit... but market it as "healthy"?

And what is "healthy", anyway? This _real fruit!_ pillow --

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_(sidebar: I **love** the name Pillow. It's just so delightful!)_

-- has more sugar in it per gram than the [Raspberry Shortcake, my beloved][link_raspberry_shortcake] - coming in at 47g/100g compared to the Shortcake's 31.6g/100g. Yes, perhaps some of that is 'natural fructose' rather than artificial, but given that added sugar is listed as the third-most common ingredient _separate_ from the fruits, I'm inclinded to believe that `for kids = drenched in sugar` in product designers' minds.

But anyway, I digress from my tirade. Marketing points aside, this is a good bickie. Aesthetically, they have this cute concave side structure like a bow-tie, with a smooth and undecorated top; this does feel like a missed opportunity for something whimsical moulded into the face. Their outer casing is a lot thicker than you might expect, which gives a surprisingly good crunch factor. That immediately meets the squishy fruit center, which is close in texture to a thick preserve or jam, but has a really punchy flavour. 

To get down to business: it's good. It's hard to really be too harsh on a product expressly designed for children. Sure, it's not as nuanced or complex as the profile of a Monte Carlo, but... it's for kids, and for that given purpose, it does well. 

Perhaps the most concentrated review: you'd be happy if this was in your lunchbox.
