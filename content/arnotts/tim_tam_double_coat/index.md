"Hey boss, those Tim Tams - what if we just made them better?"

\... Is what I assume was said in the lab when these were ~~discovered~~ invented. Unlike the many other derivatives, the double coat does not fundamentally change the formula laid down by its older sibling. There's no mint/butterscotch/coconut flavour experimentation - it's just thicker chocolate, that's all.

> Arnott’s Tim Tam Double Coat is a delicious biscuit with a mouth-watering combination of crunchy biscuit, luscious cream centre, wrapped in a thicker milk chocolate coating. It’s easy to see why Tim Tam is Australia’s most-loved chocolate biscuit.

I feel like I could sum up this review in one meme:

I don't believe you lose anything by adding a coat, and I think anyone who likes Tim Tams would like these too. Based on that, it's clear these need to best their progenitor on the list, but they'll ultimately fall into a similar standing.

All of this does beg the question, though: why don't these just replace the OGs alltogether? Biscuits for thought.
