Can a biscuit get any better?

It's tough to say. There is so, _so_ much to love about the Raspberry Shortcake. It's a delicious biscuit, and you will be hearing a lot of praise for it.

For the uninitiated, this is composed of two thin, somewhat squishy slices of shortbread (one with a hole), with a thin smear of jam between, and a memorable larger dot in the middle. Strangely, the ingredients list betrays that the jam contains less than two percent actual raspberry, being largely an apple product, but I won't knock points for that at all.

I haven't heard a lot of love for the Raspberry Shortcake in my time as a self-professed Arnott's enthusiast. Perhaps it's less well-known that the popular cream options, or maybe jam just isn't in everyone's palette; regardless, I think I'm an outlier in my unabashed love for this simple bickie.

In fact, I do likely have some bias here, as I have fond memories of making similar biscuits by hand - dough, cookie-cutter shapes, apricot and plum jam, with a dusting of icing sugar. But, to be frank, this is my list, and I make the rules, so the Shortcake is getting a very high score.
