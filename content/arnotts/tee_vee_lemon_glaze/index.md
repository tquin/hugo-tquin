Fun fact: Krispy Kreme doesn't even sell the Lemon Glaze donuts in Australia, and yet they have a biscuit imitation of it on supermarket shelves.

I thought I was done with the Krispy Kreme mini-saga in October when I wrapped up the first batch of five flavours. So, imagine my surprise when I'm doing my weekly shop and see not one, but _two_ new packages on the shelf: Lemon Glaze and Mocha.

So, this month we're diving back into donut-biscuit territory, and you know what? It's not a lemon, in the [car sense][link_lemon_car] at least -- it's pretty good!

I wrote in the last-place Lemon Crisp review that I like lemon deserts, but that bickie's Achilles' heel was the bizarre and controversial choice to include _salt._ The TeeVee Snacks, instead, do not suffer the same foolhardy conviction, and keep things sweet and delicious. I enjoy the sprinkles common across most of these Krispy Kreme tie-ins, and the lemon flavour is delightful, not overbearing or under-utilised. This is a good biscuit.

I do wonder, though, if this marks a change in new product releases by Arnott's. For a long time, the Tim-Tam has been used as a testing bed for ridiculous flavour combinations, but recently there have been strange TeeVee Snack experiments, like these Krispy Kreme donuts and the Tic-Tac-Toe-looking set I'm yet to try. It's a curious development, if it's true.
