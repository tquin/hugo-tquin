Moving swiftly on from the offensive Strawberry flavour to this subtle choice.

Continuing the run of donut reviews, next up is a much more pleasant option.

These caramel snacks are delicious. They're sweet without being overpowering, and they don't slap you in the face with flavour like the [Strawberry's][link_tee_vee_strawberry_sprinkle] did previously. In that regard, they're closer to the [Original Glazed][link_tee_vee_original_glazed] cinnamon-y option I liked more.

While they can't touch the others in aesthetics, nothing has beat these so far in taste. Now, let's not go too crazy; I'm not ready to let a donut product tie-in that smells like a bit of a cash-grab top the coveted biscuit list. Within their fiefdom, within their niche, however, so far the Caramels are the top contender. Let's see where the Cookies & Cream or Choc Iced will end up landing.
