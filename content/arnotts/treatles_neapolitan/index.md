Ah McArnott's, you've done it again.

The crack crew at Arnott's HQ have again come out with not one, but a range of new products to bless us with like mana falling from their science lab. The new _Treatles,_ follows the formula laid down by its forebears: the [Obsession][link_mint_choc] series, which I swear I'll finish one day; the [TeeVee Snacks x Krispy Kreme][link_teevee_glazed] collaboration, which I can only assume sold well because they followed it up with additional flavours; and of course, the time-honoured tradition of treating the Tim-Tam property as a testing bed. In keeping with that vein, we have four Treatles to try -- all in due time, of course.

Without studying the packaging, my assumption when I picked these up was that they'd have a liquid interior, like a Freddo Frog or most of the Snack block varieties. Instead, as you read above, they're a wafer, and quite a crunchy one at that. The strawberry core is much denser than something like a [Tina Wafer][link_tina_wafer], matching closer to a honeycomb Crunchie in mouthfeel. _(Do I have Cadbury on the mind today?)_ Flavour-wise, they're pleasant, but relatively unremarkable; a welcome improvement over the sugary mess that was [the last attempt at experimental strawberry.][link_teevee_strawberry]

I like these, but they have an Achilles' heel matching like their Obsession predecessor, being their price. $6 for 90g is not a great ratio, though not as unforgivable as the mere six-biscuit tray their ancestors tried to sneak through with, because you get a decent quantity. I suppose you can't blame a wafer biscuit for having less mass, but there's just something less satisfying than a similar price for the heft of a packet of Kingstons.

So, a good rating then. But by now, we're in stiff competition, so the decisive question is: where will these place? I can't see them cracking the top ten, but they're not far off, considering they certainly get points for originality. One down, three to go.
