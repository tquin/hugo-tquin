If you asked me for the most iconic Australian recipies, along with pavlova and vegemite, the [lamington][link-lamington] would definitely make the cut.

But, as much as I hate to say it, this combination just doesn't work for me.

I _love_ Iced VoVos. The soft biscuit base, marshmallow, coconut, raspberry jam - it is iconic. Lamingtons are great too. Cocoa and coconut are a good couple, phonetically and culinarily.

> This dessert inspired biscuit combines two icons with Iced VoVo and the famous Australian Lamington. The delicious biscuit base is topped with chocolate fondant and has a jammy raspberry topping â€“ all sprinkled with coconut.

I just don't think they nailed the combination on this one. I find the cocoa a bit overpowering, and there's little left of the Iced VoVo essence beyond the physical appearance. It's still a good biscuit, and I'd be happy to have them again, but it's never my first choice. 

While I love the idea here, I think a different biscuit may have been a better fit for the lamington flavour. Add a bit of coconut to the [Creamy Chocolate][link-creamy-chocolate], and I think you'd have an outstanding winner.
