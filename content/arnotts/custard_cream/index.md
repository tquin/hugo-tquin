Every time I pick these up, I'm always thrown off by the length of the packaging. It's hard to convey it exactly, but the dimensions just feel\... _off._

However, I don't want to judge a biscuit by its packaging. Allow me to quote Arnott's themselves for the official description:

---

> Beautifully embossed sweet biscuits piped with a thick layer of smooth custard cream. Arnott's Custard Cream biscuits are the perfectly sophisticated tea time snack!

Even though these descriptions are always a little **extra**, I do agree with their love for the embossing. The pattern on these square bickies is lovely, and reminds me of the intricate scrollwork of a [really fancy fountain pen.][link-scrollwork]

This is a crumbly biscuit; closer to the shortbread side of things than Anzac. While I think it leans just _slightly_ to the dry side of things, the healthy dose of cream helps to alleviate any issues. Overall, it's a great flavour balance, provided you like custard.

No biscuit is perfect, though. The Custard Cream lets me down most in drink-dipping. It's just a bit too crumbly to hold it's structure well when soaked through. While this isn't ideal, it's by no means a deal breaker; I'm not much of a dipper anyway, but your ~~milage~~ kilometreage may vary.

Overall, I can respect this as a good, all-rounder choice. You get a decent amount in the weirdly-shaped packet, and it's a delicate, crumbly delight. While it's not my personal favourite, it's still good enough that I pick it up every few weeks.
