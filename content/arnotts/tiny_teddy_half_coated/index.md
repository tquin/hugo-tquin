While there are many Arnott's biscuits that hit me in the nostalgia, it's hard to beat the original Tiny Teddys. And while they used to come in little one-serving plastic bags, I was able to pick these up in a 200g box, which feels very indulgent.

There is an interesting ethical quandry raised by these biscuits, however, or their packaging artwork at least. Consider these three boxes side-by-side:

Clearly, as evidenced by the Honey teddies, there are golden-coloured bears, who in the Half-Coated artwork are dousing their bodies in chocolate. Surely, this _must_ imply that the Chocolate teddies have merely completed their transformation with a more thorough coat of paint.

So the question is obvious: is this a biscuit black-face? Or are these genuinely different races of biscuit; and if so, do others exist? Can a teddy independently choose to transition from chocolate to blueberry? What does it mean to be "half-coated"? All of these and more, on a children's snack.
