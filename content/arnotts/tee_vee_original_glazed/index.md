The fact they market this range as 'Arnott's x Kirspy Kreme' like it's a hypebeast shoe drop is hilarious.

And while I'm on it, calling them "dough-scuits" in the press materials from back in May is somehow even worse. Arnott's, I love you, but please stop. You're killing me here.

But let's talk about the actual ~~dough-scuit~~ biscuit. To sum it up, it's basically a [Tic Toc][link-tic-toc] with a hole in the middle, sprinkled with a touch of cinnamon. There's nothing fancy like the [Strawberry Sprinkles or Kookies & Kreme versions][link-promo] with their sprikes, but this bickie doesn't need it.

And god damn, they actually nailed it. I don't know if they got the secret recipe from Krispy Kreme HQ for this, but it seriously tastes just like the classic donut to me. Flavour-wise, I like this one, and I'm excited to try the other options they've released.

I'm not fully stoked about these, though. Other than the marketing cringe, TeeVee Snacks are pretty expensive. They're a dollar more than a standard pack of Monte Carlos, with almost 100g less for your money. While that is usually enough to turn me off the regular flavours, the novelty of the Krispy Kreme range seems worth trying. 

As spot-on as the flavour is, I don't think I'll be revisiting these any time soon. They're a fun quirk, but I'd rather try the rest of the options first. You do have to hand it to Arnott's, though, for the consistent experimentation - I love to see it.
