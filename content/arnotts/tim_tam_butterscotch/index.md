Did you know there was an Arnotts vote to introduce a new Tim Tam variant? Somehow, which I am ashamed to say, I missed it completely! It happened in April, and was [a choice between][link_vote] the Butterscotch & Cream we recieved and the proposed _Tim Tam, Dark Choc Espresso Martini,_ which I can't say I'm too upset about the result of - particularly since we just had a new [Coffee-flavoured bickie][link_tee_vee_mocha] introduced anyway.

Before we delve into opinions, there is another unique aspect to this review beyond the vote results: this was a requested review by my very own sibling. I will very happily accomodate such requests when they come with the Tim Tams free of charge ðŸ˜‰!

Okay, okay, enough pre-roll: how are they? Good. Butterscotch is a great flavour, and it's not over-used in general; it still carries a novelty that makes it fun every time you encounter it. Doesn't it remind you of a Werther's Original, a brand seemingly marketed exclusively to old grandpas? And my sibling's opinion:

> "I'm not a big Tim Tam fan, but this I enjoy."

High praise indeed.
