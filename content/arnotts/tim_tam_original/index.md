Ah, the venerable Tim-Tam. On some level, I'm astounded I've made it this far without reaching for this yet.

But that should not constitute a lack of enthusiasm on my part. In some ways, this is closer to a civic duty: the original Tim-Tam (and it's many, many derivatives) are a national pride on the same podium as Vegemite and Fairy Bread.

It's no surprise that this status has been earned for a good reason. As a biscuit, the Tim-Tam is great. As a platform, a format, it's equally notable - the form ranges from Mango to espresso.

But we're not here to discuss Murray River Salted Caramel or Moreton Bay Raspberry & Dark Choc - _both ridiculously pretentious_ - because we are here to begin our Tim-Tam journey with what started it all, all the way back in 1964.

On to the flavour: you know it's good. You know that the Tim-Tam is renowed for being crunchy, yet with a soft cream filling that reminds me of a Mars bar. Cover that in a smooth milk chocolate, and you're on to a winner. 

Along with iron ore and tertiary education, this bickie is an Australian export, perhaps nominally to reduce homesickness in expats, but undoubtedly now a global name. There are varieties produced for the US and Indonesia; what I'm trying to say is that the Tim-Tam's reputation goes before it, and I certainly can't add anything new to its discourse.

There is a thing I can contribute though - a place on the Definitive List. I'm placing it in the top ten, for now. There are many more biscuits to go, and certainly other Tim-Tam variants to go, which will likely push it down the list. But without a doubt, it has staked its claim, and long may it reign.
