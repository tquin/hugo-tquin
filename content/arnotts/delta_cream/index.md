In the first post I called these overrated, and I stand by it.

I was considering that mainly in the context of the coveted [Assorted Creams][link-assorted-creams], arguably the best of the variety packs (although that may be my bias showing). It's in tough competition - you're unlikely to win any line-up with both the Kingston and Monte Carlo in it - but there's just nothing special about the Delta Cream to me.

And, sidebar, but I can't believe that description. I'm willing to look past the biscuit appearance, but if you market this as a "twist and dunk", you're really asking for an Oreo fight, which you're sadly outmatched in.

Anyway, back to the bickie. On paper, a vanilla cream and chocolate biscuit should be a knock-out. Sadly, it falls flat. Don't get me wrong, it's _fine_,_ but it isn't _great._ In the Assorted Creams, it's not your first pick (it's not your last pick either, but I'll save clowning on the Orange Slice ðŸ¤¢ for another day.)

That's all it comes down to for me. I don't dislike them, but I wouldn't buy a packet of them on their own. The Delta Cream simply lets me down. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.
