If I had to guess, I would assume the Monte Carlo must be the most popular biscuit Arnott's produces. Not to be the [Provocative Opinion Person][link-anthropocene], but I do have to disagree (surely it's the Tim Tams.)

Not by much, though. Look, I don't think anyone can really argue that this isn't an _excellent_ biscuit. It's just not my personal number one.

And what's not to love? It's a big, thick, crunchy, flavourful, textured banger of a bickie. Cracking open the quintessential jam film to reach that weirdly smooth cream; what else can I say but _\*chef's kiss\*_ 👨‍🍳😘.

Visually, it has a rough, cracked texture on the top and bottom, with that iconic red ring of jam around the center. In my opinion, it's probably the most memorable in Arnott's collection.

I don't know if I can taste coconut or honey in the here, to be honest - maybe a hint of golden syrup. Named after the [European region][link-monaco-wiki] of the same name, these have been sold since 1926, so I hope the Queen sends the Monte Carlo a letter when it turns 100 later this decade.

Plus, these have been bestowed the honour and privilege of being included in the Assorted Creams pack. To be cynical, that must significantly boost its real estate in the national psyche, but I still think the Monte Carlo can stand on its own. 

Go on. Get a packet. You won't regret it.
