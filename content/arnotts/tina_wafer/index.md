The Tina Wafer - strange name for a biscuit, isn't it? - disappoint me a little.

I was recently quite positive about the [Gaiety][link_gaiety], if you can forgive me for getting a little existential about the hedonic treadmill that is our human condition in the review. They are, in short, a Tina Wafer covered in chocolate. At the time of writing that review, I didn't know that today's biscuit existed; I instead compared it to generic, home-brand wafer biscuits, which the Tina clearly shares a common ancestor with. In fact, I harshly described it as _"three thin pieces of edible sawdust held together with the minimum viable amount of what technically passes as cream."_

And frankly, the Tina Wafer critically does not perform the minimum set of common 'Arnotts enhancements' that raises its sibling biscuits to a premium level. It still constitutes an incredibly dry, thin, and one-dimensional flavour profile that leaves little enjoyment. The only real difference between this and the classic 60c Woolies option is that these are roughly square, rather than rectangular; but where the Gaiety represented the next step on the inevitable human march of technological biscuit progress, the Tina is a disappointing side-step, upstaged by its more economical competition, that feels ultimately like a plain-and-simple rip-off.
