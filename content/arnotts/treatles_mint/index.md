Back at it again with the obligatory mint-variation-of-experimental-new-product-category.

Much of this I suspect will be a repeat of what we uncovered in the [Neapolitan][link_nea] case, sans flavour. As a quick recap, these bad boys are mostly an airy wafer with what they try to pass off as "cream" at its heart, which I'd argue it isn't -- it's a wafer of different density. That's not to say it's a bad mouthfeel; I like the the general format of Treatles, but it's not the Caramello Koala liquid experience that I hoped from the packaging.

> Arnottâ€™s Mint Treatles are the ideal solution for whenever those sweet cravings hit. Dive into the dark chocolate layer, with a white chocolate drizzle, to discover a crispy wafer hiding a mint cream centre.

Similarities over, on to what is different: mint! Is it the _good_ kind, or the _generic white paste applied through clinical silicone nozzle_ kind? Unfortunately, they've leaned more towards the latter. I like it, but it's not as strong as a [Mint Slice][link_mint_slice] is, given the relatively small kernel of mint surrounded by the chocolate wafer. We've seen [better mints][link_mint_obsession] in our time already, so I have to favour the novelty of Neapolitan for now.
