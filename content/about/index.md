Hi! My name's Tyler, and I work in infosec in the Melbourne region. 

---

Specifically, my current work focus and experience is on:

- **Detection** - creating well-optimised SIEM rules to feed a bespoke risk-aggregation pipeline, and 
- **Orchestration** - using SOAR to automate away as much of the boring stuff as we can, and
- **Phishing** - building an alerting and response framework to detect and, more importantly, _take down_ phishing sites as soon as possible.

---

Outside of work, we do all have hobbies of course - some of mine are beekeeping, colour-coding my bookshelf, and a financially unsustainable collection of fountain pens.
